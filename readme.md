<h1>Remove Woo Product on Add to Cart</h1>
Searched for a plug-and-play solution to auto remove products from cart when a different product is added; turns out, it didn't exist.

<b>How it works:</b>

In the product settings, there's now a 'Remove Product(s) from Cart' dropdown.
Select products that get the boot when this one's added to the cart.
Update your product. The end.
Simple as that. No settings, no fluff. Just works.
